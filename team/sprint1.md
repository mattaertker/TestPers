# Sprint 1 - *digitalwebflex*

## Goal
  The goal for this sprint is to establish the team, decide on design constructs, decide on a company logo, and create the home page.
 
### Sprint Leader: *YG Daddy*

## Definition of Done
  For this sprint we will consider the sprint done when all tasks and epics are completed, a finalized version 1.0 of the web application is deployed on the computer science server, a product increment release of v1.0 is created on GitHub, and the sprint review and retrospectives are completed as a part of this report.

## Policies
  For this sprint and likely all subsequent sprints digitalwebflex will make sure that all commits that are made are properly associated with a task/issue in GitHub. All merges will be approved by at least two team members prior to merging, and that no one merges any commits directly to master or merges their own commits.

## Plan
  For this sprint we plan on releasing the ‘Home Page’ and decide on design aspects as well as a logo. Compnay email has been created and it is digitalwebflex@gmail.com, domain names have not been claimed for .com, .org, or anything else. We will be using react and SCSS to do just about everything for this project. SCSS is a preprocessor of CSS kind of like Jquery is to javascript. It is very easy to learn, and makes styling a lot cleaner. We will be using a different hot server as the one from daves class is not friendly.
